Test cases :
warAndPeace("there was never a good war, or a bad peace") → true
warAndPeace("war what is it good for") → false

Q: should the 'word' be defined as separated by space - normally it is....
test cases:
    warAndPeace("there was never a good warandpeace") 0 and 0, so equal
    warAndPeace("war what is it good for") 1 and 0, not equal
    warAndPeace("what is it good for") 0 and 0, equal
